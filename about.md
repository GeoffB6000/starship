# About

My passion lies in creating images. Actually it lies in representing things I do not normally see, something I try to do in writing as well as in art. The point of this kind of representation is to create an experience - producing an image or a piece of writing that doesn't stop at looking nice, but which promotes deeper thinking. That's the goal, anyway.
